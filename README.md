**Developing the Project**
There were three main packages. The GUI package contained all the graphics needed to properly show the chess game on screen. The Pieces Package contained all the pieces on a chess board including an abstract piece class which was extended for every piece type. The abstract class contained many getter and setter methods as well as an abstract method to find the piece's possible moves. Lastly the Game Package contained the timers, the timer interface and the Spot class which represents one indidividual spot on the chess board.
